Students - click the `launch binder` link, it'll take 2-10 minutes for the remote docker-based image to get running, then you'll have a Notebook to play with in the browser without needing to install anything:
[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ianozsvald/SuccessCourseAmes/HEAD?labpath=ames_housing_exploration.ipynb)

Take a look at `requirements.txt` if you'd like to know what is being installed.

This Notebook is used in Ian Ozsvald's [Successful Data Science Projects](https://ianozsvald.com/training/) course.
